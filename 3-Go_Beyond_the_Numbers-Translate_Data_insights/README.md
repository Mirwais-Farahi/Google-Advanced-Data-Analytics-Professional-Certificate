### Course Description

This course covers essential statistical concepts including:

- **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**: Summarize and explore data.
- **Probability Theory**: Calculate probabilities and model data distributions.
- **Sampling Methodologies**: Evaluate different sampling methods and avoid bias.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Construct and interpret intervals to describe estimate uncertainty.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct tests to determine statistical significance.

Through hands-on activities led by Google practitioners, you'll learn to effectively communicate your statistical findings and make data-driven decisions.

### Course Modules

- **Module 2: Probability**
  - Master the basic rules of probability for single and complex events.
  - Learn about probability distributions (binomial, Poisson, normal).
  - Apply methods like Bayesâ€™ theorem to describe complex events.

- **Module 3: Sampling**
  - Understand sampling methodologies and how to avoid bias.
  - Learn to draw conclusions about large datasets using smaller samples.
  - Analyze sample data and make accurate estimates.

- **Module 4: Confidence Intervals**
  - Learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals.
  - Understand how confidence intervals describe the uncertainty of estimates.
  - Avoid common misinterpretations of confidence intervals.

- **Module 5: Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**
  - Understand the steps for conducting hypothesis tests.
  - Learn how to determine if test results are statistically significant.
  - Draw meaningful conclusions from data using hypothesis testing.

- **Module 6: End-of-Course Project**
  - Apply statistical methods such as hypothesis testing to analyze a workplace scenario dataset.
  - Demonstrate your proficiency in the statistical techniques covered throughout the course.
